A high-performance Julia implementation of the GraphMERT algorithm for constructing reliable biomedical knowledge graphs from unstructured text data. This package provides efficient and scalable distillation of knowledge graphs using RoBERTa-based architecture with Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (H-GAT).

## Overview

GraphMERT.jl implements the state-of-the-art GraphMERT algorithm from the paper "GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data" (arXiv:2510.09580). The implementation is specifically optimized for biomedical text processing and knowledge graph construction, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.

### Key Features

- **RoBERTa-based Encoder**: Leverages pre-trained RoBERTa models for robust text understanding
- **Hierarchical Graph Attention (H-GAT)**: Advanced attention mechanisms for semantic relation encoding
- **Leafy Chain Graph Structure**: Novel graph representation for text with semantic nodes
- **UMLS Integration**: Seamless integration with the Unified Medical Language System
- **Helper LLM Support**: External language model integration for enhanced entity discovery
- **Dual Training Objectives**: MLM (Masked Language Modeling) + MNM (Masked Node Modeling)
- **High Performance**: Processes 5,000+ tokens per second on standard hardware
- **Memory Efficient**: Handles datasets up to 124.7M tokens with <4GB memory usage

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("GraphMERT")
```

### System Requirements

- Julia 1.8 or higher
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB+ recommended for large datasets)
- CUDA support optional but recommended for GPU acceleration

## Quick Start

```julia
using GraphMERT

# Load a pre-trained model
model = load_model("path/to/graphmert_model.onnx")

# Extract knowledge graph from biomedical text
text = "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy is the primary treatment for type 1 diabetes."

# Process with default configuration
graph = extract_knowledge_graph(text, model)

# Access results
println("Extracted $(length(graph.entities)) entities")
println("Extracted $(length(graph.relations)) relations")

# View entity details
for entity in graph.entities
    println("$(entity.text) [$(entity.label)] (confidence: $(entity.confidence))")
end

# View relations
for relation in graph.relations
    println("$(relation.head) --[$(relation.relation_type)]--> $(relation.tail)")
end
```

## Architecture

The GraphMERT implementation follows a sophisticated multi-stage architecture:

### 1. Text Preprocessing

- Tokenization and encoding using RoBERTa tokenizer
- Biomedical entity recognition and normalization
- UMLS concept mapping and disambiguation

### 2. Graph Construction

- Leafy chain graph generation from token sequences
- Semantic node creation with hierarchical structure
- Edge weight computation using attention mechanisms

### 3. Knowledge Extraction

- Entity extraction with confidence scoring
- Relation prediction using H-GAT networks
- Multi-hop reasoning for complex relationships

### 4. Quality Assurance

- FActScore and ValidityScore evaluation
- Confidence-based filtering
- Biomedical domain validation
