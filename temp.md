You are now using a thinking model. I want you to:

- review the current specifications and plan.
- better understand the original paper and its expanded local rewrite (/original_paper/expanded_rewrite) - review the existing code for improvement areas to achieve the specs.

The new specification document should cover all components (RoBERTa, H-GAT, Leafy Chain Graphs, MLM, MNM, Seed Injection, etc.)

Current Code Analysis: get a thorough understanding of the current codebase, existing documentation, and specifications.

- What's implemented vs. placeholder?
- Missing implementations vs. paper requirements
- Code quality issues
- Areas needing expansion

Any questions?
