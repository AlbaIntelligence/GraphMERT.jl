# GraphMERT Algorithm Replication - Implementation Tasks

**Feature:** GraphMERT Algorithm Replication
**Objective:** Replicate the GraphMERT algorithm in Julia to construct biomedical knowledge graphs using RoBERTa+H-GAT architecture
**Timeline:** 3 months for complete implementation and validation

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope:** Phase 1-3 (Core Architecture + Basic Knowledge Graph Extraction)
**Incremental Delivery:** Each phase builds upon the previous, with independent testability
**Parallel Opportunities:** Multiple components can be developed simultaneously within each phase
**Progressive Testing:** Every code improvement must be tested, compilation must be clean, and changes committed as separate documented commits

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order:**

1. **Phase 1-2:** Setup and foundational components (blocking prerequisites)
2. **Phase 3:** Core GraphMERT architecture implementation
3. **Phase 4:** Biomedical domain integration and UMLS
4. **Phase 5:** Training pipeline and MLM+MNM objectives
5. **Phase 6:** Evaluation and benchmarking
6. **Phase 7:** API and Integration
7. **Phase 8:** Testing and Validation
8. **Phase 9:** Documentation and Examples
9. **Phase 10:** Polish and Optimization
10. **Phase 11:** Non-Functional Requirements Implementation

**Progressive Testing Requirements:**
- Every code change must pass compilation without warnings
- Every code change must include corresponding tests
- Every code change must be committed as a separate documented commit
- Each phase must have a testing gate before proceeding to the next phase

**Robustness and Trust Focus:**
The additional tasks (T024-T060) beyond the core requirements are intentionally designed to make the replication more robust and trustworthy:

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensures every component is thoroughly validated
- **Performance Validation:** Verifies the implementation meets or exceeds original paper benchmarks
- **API Completeness:** Provides a full-featured API for real-world usage
- **Documentation Excellence:** Enables easy adoption and understanding
- **Code Quality:** Creates a reference implementation that demonstrates Julia best practices
- **Scientific Rigor:** Ensures reproducibility and validation against original results

This approach builds confidence in the replication's accuracy and completeness, making it suitable for both research and production use.

**Parallel Execution Examples:**

- **Phase 3:** RoBERTa implementation || H-GAT development || Leafy chain graph structure
- **Phase 4:** UMLS integration || Biomedical entity types || Helper LLM integration
- **Phase 5:** MLM objective || MNM objective || Seed KG injection algorithm

## Testing Gates and Quality Assurance

- **Integration Gate:** All components must integrate successfully
- **Performance Gate:** Performance benchmarks must meet or exceed targets
- **Documentation Gate:** All new APIs must have complete documentation

### Commit Requirements

Every code improvement must follow this process:

1. **Code Change:** Implement the improvement
2. **Test Addition:** Add corresponding tests
3. **Compilation Check:** Ensure clean compilation
4. **Test Execution:** Run all tests and verify they pass
5. **Documentation Update:** Update relevant documentation
6. **Commit:** Create a separate documented commit with clear description
