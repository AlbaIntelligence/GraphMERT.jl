# GraphMERT Implementation Research - Updated

**Purpose:** Resolve all technical clarifications for GraphMERT algorithm replication in Julia based on original paper analysis
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Feature:** GraphMERT Algorithm Replication

## Research Findings Based on Original Paper

### 1. GraphMERT Architecture Implementation

**Decision:** Implement exact RoBERTa-based architecture with H-GAT (Hierarchical Graph Attention) as per original paper

**Rationale:**

- Original paper shows GraphMERT is a RoBERTa-style encoder with H-GAT components
- 80M parameter model provides optimal balance for laptop deployment
- H-GAT enables semantic relation encoding essential for knowledge graph construction
- Biomedical domain focus requires specific architecture for UMLS integration

**Alternatives considered:**

- TinyBERT adaptation: Would lose scientific accuracy and paper fidelity
- Generic transformer: Would miss GraphMERT-specific components
- ONNX-based approach: Would not capture H-GAT architecture properly

**Implementation notes:**

- Implement RoBERTa encoder with custom H-GAT attention layers
- Use Julia ML ecosystem (Flux.jl, Transformers.jl) for architecture
- Implement leafy chain graph structure for text representation
- Integrate UMLS biomedical knowledge base for entity linking

### 2. Biomedical Domain Integration

**Decision:** Implement full biomedical pipeline with UMLS integration as per original paper

**Rationale:**

- Original paper specifically targets biomedical domain with diabetes dataset
- UMLS integration provides standardized biomedical entity linking
- SNOMED CT and Gene Ontology vocabularies are essential for biomedical accuracy
- FActScore and ValidityScore metrics are domain-specific

**Alternatives considered:**

- General-purpose approach: Would lose scientific accuracy and paper fidelity
- Simplified biomedical integration: Would miss critical UMLS components
- Multi-domain approach: Would dilute focus and scientific rigor

**Implementation notes:**

- Integrate UMLS knowledge base for entity linking and validation
- Use SNOMED CT and Gene Ontology vocabularies
- Implement biomedical-specific entity and relation types
- Focus on diabetes dataset for validation and benchmarking

### 3. Helper LLM Integration

**Decision:** Use Julia-compatible LLM integration for helper tasks (entity discovery, relation matching)

**Rationale:**

- Original paper uses Qwen3-32B as helper LLM for entity discovery
- Helper LLM is essential for biomedical entity discovery and relation matching
- Julia ecosystem needs LLM integration for complete GraphMERT pipeline
- Entity discovery and relation matching are critical for seed KG preparation

**Alternatives considered:**

- Native Julia implementation: Would require extensive development time
- External API calls: Would introduce latency and dependency issues
- Simplified approach: Would miss critical helper LLM functionality

**Implementation notes:**

- Integrate with Julia-compatible LLM libraries
- Implement entity discovery prompts for biomedical domain
- Use helper LLM for relation matching and triple combination
- Maintain scientific accuracy while enabling Julia ecosystem integration

### 4. Training Pipeline Implementation

**Decision:** Implement full training pipeline with MLM + MNM objectives for complete replication

**Rationale:**

- Original paper shows complete training pipeline is essential for GraphMERT
- MLM + MNM objectives are core to GraphMERT methodology
- Seed KG injection algorithm is critical for training data preparation
- Full training pipeline enables scientific reproducibility

**Alternatives considered:**

- Inference-only approach: Would miss core GraphMERT methodology
- Simplified training: Would lose scientific accuracy and paper fidelity
- External training: Would not capture Julia-specific optimizations

**Implementation notes:**

- Implement MLM (Masked Language Modeling) objective
- Implement MNM (Masked Node Modeling) objective
- Develop seed KG injection algorithm
- Create leafy chain graph training data structure
- Implement span masking and boundary loss

### 5. Evaluation Methodology

**Decision:** Implement GraphRAG evaluation methodology with FActScore and ValidityScore metrics

**Rationale:**

- Original paper uses GraphRAG for KG evaluation and benchmarking
- FActScore (69.8%) and ValidityScore (68.8%) are paper-specific metrics
- GraphRAG provides comprehensive KG quality assessment
- Biomedical domain requires specific evaluation metrics

**Alternatives considered:**

- Generic evaluation: Would miss domain-specific requirements
- Simplified metrics: Would lose scientific rigor
- External evaluation: Would not capture Julia-specific performance

**Implementation notes:**

- Implement GraphRAG evaluation methodology
- Develop FActScore and ValidityScore calculation
- Create biomedical-specific evaluation benchmarks
- Integrate with diabetes dataset for validation
