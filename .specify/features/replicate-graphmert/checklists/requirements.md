# Specification Quality Checklist: GraphMERT Replication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Feature**: [GraphMERT Algorithm Replication](.specify/features/replicate-graphmert/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Focused on user value and outcomes
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Clear research and scientific objectives
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Accessible to researchers and data scientists
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - All required sections present and comprehensive

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All clarifications resolved
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Clear success criteria and metrics defined
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - Quantitative metrics with specific targets
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - Focused on outcomes, not implementation details
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Primary and secondary user flows covered
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Error handling and malformed input addressed
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - 3-month timeline, laptop deployment, single dataset
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Clear technical and resource assumptions
- [x] Elegant code requirements specified - Clear expectations for code quality and design

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each REQ has measurable outcomes
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Input processing and validation flows defined
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - All SC items addressed
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Focused on what, not how
- [x] Code elegance requirements are well-defined - Clear expectations for Julia best practices

## Code Quality Standards

- [x] Elegant code requirements are specific and measurable
- [x] Multiple dispatch usage is clearly defined
- [x] Type system usage expectations are specified
- [x] Functional programming principles are outlined
- [x] Design patterns are identified for implementation guidance
- [x] Code elegance success criteria are technology-agnostic

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All clarifications have been resolved
- Timeline and scope are well-defined
- Technical approach (ONNX.jl) is appropriate for laptop deployment
- Elegant code requirements add significant value for community adoption
- Code elegance principles and design patterns provide clear implementation guidance
- Success criteria include both technical and aesthetic quality measures
